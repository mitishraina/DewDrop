# 🌫 DewDrop – Sip the sky 🌫

## Welcome to DewDrop!
For a while, we've wondered about high voltage static charge to attract, then condense fog into drinkable water. Building a most efficient fog condenser possible(and going thru lot of high voltage shocks), What ended up being built, could possibly have large scale implications for heavy fog.

A cutting-edge fog harvesting system that doesn't just capture water from the foggy air but does it 10x better than existing solutions! Imagine transforming dense fog into clean water with a 90% efficiency rate—sounds like something from the future, right? Well, the future is here! 🌍💧


## 🌍 Background and Problem Statement
- Water scarcity affects over 1.1 billion people worldwide, particularly in drought-prone coastal regions with regular fog but little rainfall.
- Traditional fog collection relies on passive mesh structures, which have low efficiency (~1-2%) due to aerodynamic limitations that cause fog droplets to bypass the mesh.
- Prior research has focused on improving mesh designs and coatings, but these approaches have not significantly increased efficiency.

How do we solve this?
We introduce DewDrop – a cutting-edge, AI-powered fog water harvesting and management system that integrates smart sensors, ionized dehumidification, and real-time data analytics to efficiently extract and manage atmospheric water.


## Technologies Used

### Hardware
We’re not just throwing some mesh into the sky and hoping for the best. Our hardware stack includes:

-  **pH Sensor** – Measures the acidity of the water
-  **TDS Sensor** – Checks for total dissolved solids
-  **Humidity & Temperature Sensor** – Tracks environmental conditions
-  **Humidifier** – Enhances fog collection
-  **Metal Mesh** – Maximizes water capture
-  **Ionizer** – Supercharges the efficiency

### Software
Our device is brainy too, thanks to:

- **React.js** – For a smooth, interactive web experience
- **Node.js & Express.js** – Powering real-time data analysis
- **Artificial Intelligence** – Smart predictions and system optimizations

## How It Works (Workflow)
Think of DewDrop as a high-tech fog whisperer 🌫🤖

1. **Hardware collects environmental data using sensors**
2. **Ionized-Dehumidifier pulls water from the air**
3. **Data is sent to our website, where:**
   - Water quality is analyzed
   - Real-time data insights are displayed
   - Fog density is predicted for maximum efficiency

**Bonus**: The system even has centralized management for total control!

### Where We Make Money
- ✔ **Government Partnerships** – Deploying DewDrop in fog-heavy, accident-prone areas
- ✔ **Airport Collaborations** – Reducing heavy fog, preventing flight delays & losses

## Future Plans
DewDrop isn’t just a device—it’s a vision! We’re working on:

- ☀ **Solar-powered operations for sustainability**
- **Built-in filtration system for drinkable water**
- **Web3 integration for decentralized management**

## 🔗 Join the Revolution
Water scarcity is real, and DewDrop is here to fight it one foggy day at a time!
